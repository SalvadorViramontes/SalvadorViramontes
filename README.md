### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is âœ¨Salvador Viramontesâœ¨
I am an Electronic engineer that found in programming a true passion.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a Junior developer on frontend technologies like Angular.js (I know, super trending...), also on backend technologies like C# .Net Framework and .Net Core MVC
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects with Node.js, C#, and Python languages.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with applied machine learning as it is the main reason I decided to explore more of the immense programming world.
