### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is âœ¨Salvador Viramontesâœ¨
I am an electronic engineer that found in programming a true passion.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a Junior full-stack developer on front-end technologies like Angular.js (I know, super trending...), also on back-end technologies like C# .Net Framework and .Net Core MVC
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects with Node.js, C#, and Python languages.
